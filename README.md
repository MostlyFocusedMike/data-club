# Data Club
A site that stores our curriculum and schedule in one place. 

## What's Data Club? 
Some of the Access Labs graduates decided that we wanted to dip our toes in the data science pool. 
I figured a good way to make sure we actually progress is to work together and meet each week, to
talk about what we learned. 

Our curriculum is based off of materials that were collected by an actual data sciencist, in order to 
ensure that we didn't study from inferior materials. If you'd like to follow along, go right ahead! 
Hopefully this is a collection of good resources that anyone can use.

## AngularJS and Webpack
To really get the most out of this project, I decided to build it using WebPack and AngularJS. 
My department at my job uses those, and I'm not as familiar with them as I'd like. The site uses a 
"fake" database, since I didn't want to put up with sleeping heroku servers, and because there really
isn't anything that a user can update.
